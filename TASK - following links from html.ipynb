    "In this assignment you will write a Python program that expands on http://www.py4e.com/code3/urllinks.py. The program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below, extract the href= vaues from the anchor tags, scan for a tag that is in a particular position relative to the first name in the list, follow that link and repeat the process a number of times and report the last name you find.\n",

    "The web pages tweak the height between the links and hide the page after a few seconds to make it difficult for you to do the assignment without writing a Python program. But frankly with a little effort and patience you can overcome these attempts to make it a little harder to complete the assignment without writing a Python program. But that is not the point. The point is to write a clever Python program to solve the program.\n",
